Leetroid
========

Introduction
------------
Leetroid is an Android app showing solutions and discussions to [LeetCode](http://www.leetcode.com/), which is a useful OJ website to improve coding skills. I wrote this app to make it easier for me to review basic algorithms, and I hope it will do good to you too. 

Basically, the solutions here are written in Java, they may not be optimal but are ensured to be correct. 

Functions
---------
* Showing solutions to problems
* Star and unstar to mark problems
* Quickly find problems with key word
* Online discussions to problems
