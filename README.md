Leetroid is an Android app showing solutions and discussions to [LeetCode](http://www.leetcode.com/), which is a useful OJ website to improve coding skills. With both specific codes(with syntax highlighting) and ample dicussions, this app makes learning algorithms simpler and quicker. Hope you will like it.

Basically, the solutions here are written in Java, they may not be optimal but are ensured to be correct.
